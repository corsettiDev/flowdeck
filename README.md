# FlowDeck

> **Note: This project is currently under active development.**

## Objective

FlowDeck is a method for using a Stream Deck profile to enhance the Webflow build experience. The primary objective is to create a comprehensive profile to automate some of the more complex tasks required when building with Webflow frameworks like Client-First. This will allow you to streamline your workflow and stay organized throughout your build, while providing intuitive control over various build actions and object creation.

## Project Status

FlowDeck is still a work in progress. We are actively developing and refining the Stream Deck profile to ensure it meets the needs of Webflow developers. 

## Features (planned)

- Intuitive control of Webflow build actions
- Real-time visual feedback for seamless workflows
- Enhanced productivity and speed for Webflow development
- Profiles for Stream Deck, Stream Deck XL, and Stream Deck Mini (iOS Free Tier)
- Profiles tailored to Client-First Framework (other frameworks to follow)

Please note that while we strive to provide a stable and reliable solution, FlowDeck is currently a work in progress. Use it at your own risk, and we appreciate your understanding and patience during the development process.
